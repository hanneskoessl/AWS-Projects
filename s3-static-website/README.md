# Deploying a Static Website with Hugo and AWS S3

## 1. Project Overview

This project involves creating a recipe website using **Hugo** as the static site generator and deploying the site on **Amazon S3** for hosting. The focus of this project is demonstrating the use of **AWS S3** for static website hosting, utilizing Access Control Lists (ACL) for managing permissions.

## 2. Hugo Setup and Theme Installation

To build the website, I used Hugo with the **Quiet Foodie** theme:

- **Commands used**:
  
  ```bash
  hugo new site my-recipes-site
  cd my-recipes-site
  git clone https://github.com/paposeco/quietfoodie.git themes/quietfoodie
  hugo server
  ```

After initializing the site, I adjusted the configuration file (hugo.toml) to match the selected theme's requirements.

## 3. Adding Recipes

To add content to the website, I created recipe pages in Markdown format. An example command to add a recipe:

- **Commands used**:

  ```bash
  hugo new recipes/pizza.md
  ```

This created a Markdown file under the content/recipes/ directory, which was later populated with recipe details.

## 4. Deployment on Amazon S3

The key aspect of this project is hosting the Hugo-generated website on Amazon S3.

Steps taken:
#### 1. Building the site:

- I used the Hugo build command to generate the static files for deployment:

  ```bash
  hugo
  ```

- The static files were created in the public/ directory.


#### 2. Uploading to S3:

- I created a new S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console, ensuring that the bucket name matched the required naming conventions for hosting.
- The generated static files were uploaded to the S3 bucket, ensuring the correct directory structure.


#### 3. Configuring S3 for Static Website Hosting:

- Enabled Static website hosting in the S3 bucket settings.
- Specified index.html as the entry point for the site.
- Set 404.html as the custom error page.

#### 4. Setting Permissions using ACL:

- Configured the Access Control List (ACL) to make the website publicly accessible.
- Applied public read permissions to the objects within the bucket so that users can access the siteâ€™s assets (HTML, CSS, images, etc.).

#### 5. Testing the Website:

- The website was tested by accessing the S3 bucket URL generated by Amazon. All resources (HTML, CSS, images) were loaded correctly, confirming that the deployment was successful.

#### 6. Website URL:
- The site is accessible at the S3 endpoint URL:
